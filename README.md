# secure-payment-emulator
Project implements a secure RFID authentication system using Arduino Uno and MFRC522. It verifies authorized card UIDs and performs a XOR-based challenge-response using a secret key stored in RFID card memory. Access is granted only to registered and correctly authenticated cards. Ideal for demonstrating embedded system security.
